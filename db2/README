When Berkeley DB is distributed as part of the GNU system, the Berkeley
DB license requirement that derivative works using Berkeley DB themselves
be freely redistributable, does not apply to programs loading standard
UNIX interfaces via the GNU C library and dynamically loading Berkeley DB
support to obtain the underlying functionality.
