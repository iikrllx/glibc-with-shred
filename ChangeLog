	* configure.in (aux_missing warning): Change "too old" to
	"incompatible versions", since for autoconf it's "too new" right now.
	* configure: Regenerated.

	* configure.in (AUTOCONF): New check to set it.  Set to "no" if the
	one found doesn't work on our configure.in.
	* configure: Regenerated.
	* config.make.in (AUTOCONF): New substituted variable.
	* Makefile (autoconf-it-cvs): New canned sequence, broken out of ...
	(autoconf-it): ... here, use that instead of defining conditionally.
	Use $(AUTOCONF) instead of literal autoconf.
	[$(AUTOCONF) != no] (configure, %/configure): Protect these rules
	with this condition.
	* Make-dist (autoconf-it, configure, %/configure): Copy those changes.

	* Make-dist (dist): Cleanup a bit.  We are not interested in the
	14 char filename limit anymore.  Remove intermediate files and
	symlinks.
