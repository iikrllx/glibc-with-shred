   See the Alpha Architecture Handbook section 4.7.7.3 for details,

   extra exception bits so for proper IEEE support the tracking has to
   be done in software -- in this case with kernel support.

   As to why the system call interface isn't in the same format as
   the hardware register, only those crazy folks at DEC can tell you.  */
