/* This definition is only used if inlining fails for this function; see
   the last page of <sys/stat.h>.  The real work is done by the `x'
   function which is passed a version number argument.  We arrange in the
   makefile that when not inlined this function is always statically
   linked; that way a dynamically-linked executable always encodes the
   version number corresponding to the data structures it uses, so the `x'
   functions in the shared library can adapt without needing to recompile
   all callers.  */
