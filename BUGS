	    List of known bugs (certainly very incomplete)
	    ----------------------------------------------

Time-stamp: <1997-09-28T22:58:35+0200 drepper>

This following list contains those bugs which I'm aware of.  Please
make sure that bugs you report are not listed here.  If you can fix one
of these bugs/limitations I'll certainly be glad to receive a patch.

Another source of information about bugs is the problem data base of the
GNU project.  There is an easy to use WWW interface available at

	http://www-gnats.gnu.ai.mit.edu:8080/cgi-bin/wwwgnats.pl

I would appreciate it very much if you could verify the problem was not
reported before by looking through the database.  To make the information
in this database as useful as possible please report bugs always using the
`glibcbug' shell script which gets installed with GNU libc.

Severity: [  *] to [***]


[ **]  There are problems with signal handling when using LinuxThreads.

[ **]  The libm-ieee `log2' function seems to be very inaccurate.

[  *]  The libm-ieee `remquo' function rounds 3.0/2.0 incorrectly.

[  *]  The precision of the `sinhl' and/or `asinhl' function do not seem
       to be the best.

[  *]  The syslog function should print to the console if the LOG_CONS
       flag was given.
       [PR libc/72]

[  *]  On Linux, the <linux/posix_types.h> is not clean enough to satisfy
       the C++ namespace rules.  Declaring `struct fd_set' also makes
       `fd_set' available in the global namespace which conflicts with
       the definition of `fd_set' in glibc.
       [PR libc/79]

[  *]  On Linux, there should be a way to prevent defining the symbol
       NGROUPS_MAX in the <linux/limits.h> header file.  In glibc it
       is defined in <posix1_lim.h> which must not make the other
       symbols in <linux/limits.h> available.
       [PR libc/140]

[  *]  The localedef program should not generate errors if for categories
       which are not used for the output there are characters referenced
       which are not defined in the charmap.
       [PR libc/229]

[  *]  The rcmd() functions (more concrete: the handling of .rhosts) does
       not support netgroups and wildcards (+).

[  *]  The first alias definition in locale.alias is ignored.
       [PR libc/205]

[  *]  When assembling a locale definition, that uses the "copy"
       directive, with localedef, not only the copied category is
       checked for errors, but the whole file containing the same
       category.
       [PR libc/207]

[  *]  configuring with CFLAGS="-pipe" configure doesn't work
       with gcc. This seems to be a bug in gcc 2.7.2.x (egcs doesn't
       have this bug).
       [PR libc/245]
