     CLONE_SETTLS

	new thread.

     CLONE_PARENT_SETTID
	The kernels writes the thread ID of the newly created thread
	into the location pointed to by the fifth parameters to CLONE.

	Note that it would be semantically equivalent to use
	CLONE_CHILD_SETTID but it is be more expensive in the kernel.

     CLONE_CHILD_CLEARTID
	The kernels clears the thread ID of a thread that has called
	sys_exit() in the location pointed to by the seventh parameter
	to CLONE.

     CLONE_DETACHED
