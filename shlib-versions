# This file defines the shared library version numbers we will install.

# The following lines list filename patterns matching canonical configurations,
# and the associated versions to use for various libraries.  The entire
# list is processed, with earlier entries taking precedence over later
# entries.  So loose patterns at the end of the list can give defaults.

# Configuration		Library versions
# -------------		------- --------

# The interface to -lm depends only on cpu, not on operating system.
i.86-.*-.*		libm=6
m68k-.*-.*		libm=6
alpha-.*-.*		libm=6

# We provide libc.so.6 for Linux kernel versions 2.0 and later.
i.86-.*-linux.*		libc=6
m68k-.*-linux.*		libc=6
alpha-.*-linux.*	libc=6.1

# libmachuser.so.1 corresponds to mach/*.defs as of Utah's UK22 release.
.*-.*-gnu-gnu.*		libmachuser=1

# libhurduser.so.0.0 corresponds to hurd/*.defs as of 7 May 1996.
.*-.*-gnu-gnu*		libhurduser=0.0

# libc.so.0.2 is for the Hurd alpha release 0.2.
.*-.*-gnu-gnu*		libc=0.2

# The dynamic loader also requires different names.
i.86-.*-linux.*		ld=ld-linux.so.2
# We use the ELF ABI standard name for the default.
.*-.*-.*		ld=ld.so.1

# The -ldl interface (see <dlfcn.h>) is the same on all platforms.
.*-.*-.*		libdl=2

# So far the -lutil interface is the same on all platforms, except for the
# `struct utmp' format, which depends on libc.
.*-.*-.*		libutil=1

# Version number 2 is used on other systems for the BIND 4.9.5 resolver
# interface.
.*-.*-.*		libresolv=2

# Interface revision of nss_* modules.  This must match NSS_SHLIB_REVISION
# in nss/nsswitch.h, which determines the library names used for service
# names given in /etc/nsswitch.conf.
.*-.*-.*		libnss_files=1
.*-.*-.*		libnss_dns=1
.*-.*-.*		libnss_db=1
.*-.*-.*		libnss_compat=1
.*-.*-.*		libnss_nis=1

# Version for libnsl with YP functions.
.*-.*-.*		libnsl=1

# We use libdb.so.2 for the interface in version 1.85 of the Berkeley DB code.
.*-.*-.*		libdb=2

# This defines the shared library version numbers we will install.
.*-.*-.*		libcrypt=1

# The gross patch for programs assuming broken locale implemenations.
.*-.*-.*		libBrokenLocale=1
